Task 1. Choose a blockchain and set up the devnet/testnet

Choose Solana as the blockchain for this assignment. We'll use the Solana devnet for testing purposes.

To set up the Solana devnet, you'll need to install the Solana CLI on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the Solana documentation page: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

Once you have the Solana CLI installed, you can create a new Solana devnet account using the following command: "solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json"

Task 2: Create a simple smart contract

We'll create a simple Solana program that allows users to flip a coin and update their token balance accordingly.

Task 3: Create a website with a coin flip game

We'll create a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to connect their Solana wallet, select the amount of tokens to risk, and choose a side.
